# 🌿 One-To-Many Bidirectional With Key Parameters (Spring Boot JPA Demo)

This project is a **Spring Boot JPA Demo** that explores how to implement a  
👉 **One-To-Many Bidirectional Relationship with Composite Key Parameters**  
using **Hibernate** and **Spring Data JPA**.

It serves as a **practical companion** to the theory explained in my Medium article:  
📖 [Spring Data JPA: Mastering OneToMany and ManyToOne Relationships](https://medium.com/@hansana.etec1216/spring-data-jpa-mastering-onetomany-and-manytoone-relationships-f3084cc3368c)

> 💡 **This project helps you understand the practical implementation** of One-To-Many and Many-To-One mappings with composite keys, and how both sides of the relationship interact in real-world Spring Boot applications.
